This is the first project in the front end roadmap of roadmap.sh, and it consists of creating a basic HTML website to show a CV. This may be improved upon in the future when I learn CSS and JS, but for now will serve as an introduction to HTML for me. Currently is filled with placeholder values for now.

See the project brief at [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv)
