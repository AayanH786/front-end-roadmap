This is the second project in the front end roadmap of roadmap.sh, and it consists of creating a basic HTML website with multiple pages and structures, such as footers, headers, articles and sections. This may be improved upon in the future when I learn CSS, JS and PHP, but for now will serve as an introduction to HTML for me. Currently is filled with placeholder values.
